      "full": "The Dullahan is one of the most feared figures in Irish folklore—a headless rider who serves as a death messenger and psychopomp (spirit that guides souls to the afterlife). This supernatural being rides a black horse (sometimes also headless) while carrying his own severed head under one arm. The head is described as having a hideous grin, pallid or greenish skin, and glowing or phosphorescent properties that allow it to see great distances in the dark. The Dullahan uses a human spine as a whip to drive his horse. When the Dullahan stops riding and calls out a person's name, that person immediately dies—there is no escape. The Dullahan arrives at the location where someone is about to die. His black horse breathes flames, and locked gates fly open at his approach while water splashes away from his path. Despite his terrifying nature, the Dullahan has one weakness: gold. He is repelled by even the smallest amount of gold and will flee if gold is shown to him. The Dullahan influenced the American legend of the Headless Horseman, particularly through Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' though the Irish original is far more supernatural and sinister."
