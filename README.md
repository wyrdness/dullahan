## Overview

The **Dullahan** (Irish: *Dulachán*, meaning "dark man") is one of the most feared figures in Irish folklore—a headless horseman who serves as a death omen and messenger. This supernatural being rides a black horse through the night while carrying his own severed head under one arm. When the Dullahan stops riding and calls out a person's name, that person immediately dies.

**Physical Description**:
- **Headless body** riding a black horse
- **Carries own head** under arm or held high
- **Head features**: Hideous grin, pallid/greenish skin, glowing or phosphorescent
- **Spine whip**: Uses human spine to drive the horse
- **Black horse**: Supernatural steed, sometimes also headless, breathing flames

**Supernatural Powers**:
- **Death calling**: Speaking your name brings instant death
- **Far-seeing**: Head can see vast distances in darkness
- **Death sense**: Knows where and when death will occur
- **Supernatural passage**: Gates fly open, water parts before him

**Weakness**:
- **Gold**: The only thing the Dullahan fears. Even a small amount of gold will make him flee.

The Dullahan is not malevolent in the traditional sense—he does not cause death but serves as its messenger, announcing when someone's time has come. He is implacable and cannot be stopped or bargained with. The Dullahan influenced the American legend of the Headless Horseman, particularly Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."
